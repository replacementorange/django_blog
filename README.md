# Django Blog Site

A simple blogging platform build with Django where admin user can create and manage blog posts, categorize them, and engage with readers trought comments.

## Learning Outcomes

My personal learning outcomes in this project can answer the following questions:

- How to setup a new Django project?
- How to create and edit blog posts?
- How to display posts for users?
- How to assign different categories to a post?
- How to allow users to comment on the posts?

Additionally, I became familiar with the following:

- Learned how to generate and utilize a test coverage report.
- Got familiar with VS Code's Copilot extension:
    - My handwritten unit testing (82% coverage) attempts were destroyed by Copilotâ€™s 94% coverage.
